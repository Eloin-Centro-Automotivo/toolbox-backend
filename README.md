## üöÄ Key Features
- **Mechanic and Tool Management:** Allows adding, editing, viewing, and deleting mechanics and tools.
- **Default Inventory:** Assigns a standard set of tools to each mechanic, simplifying inventory management.
- **Daily Tool Conference:** Records missing tools during daily conferences based on the default inventory.
- **PDF Report Generation:** Creates daily and aggregate reports on missing tools, as well as inventory checklists per mechanic.
- **RESTful API:** Provides endpoints for interacting with the application, enabling future integrations or frontend development.

## üí° How It Works
- **Data Management:**
  - **Mechanics:** Add, edit, view, and delete mechanic information.
  - **Tools:** Manage the available tools catalog, including name and category.
- **Default Inventory:**
  - Assign a standard set of tools to each mechanic, facilitating initial setup and ensuring each mechanic has the necessary tools.
- **Daily Conference:**
  - Conduct daily conferences where mechanics report the tools they have. The application identifies which tools are missing based on the default inventory and records these absences.
- **Report Generation:**
  - **Daily Report:** Lists the missing tools on a specific date, grouped by mechanic.
  - **Aggregate Report:** Shows the number of missing instances per tool on a specific date.
  - **Inventory Checklist:** Generates a checklist of standard tools grouped by category for each mechanic.

## üîß Tools and Technologies Used
- [**Flask:**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) A lightweight and flexible web framework for Python application development.
- [**SQLAlchemy:**](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for efficient database interactions.
- [**SQLite:**](https://www.sqlite.org/) A lightweight database used for data storage.
- [**ReportLab:**](https://www.reportlab.com/) A library for generating PDF documents.
- [**Python:**](https://www.python.org/) A versatile and widely-used programming language.

## üìã Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- [**Git:**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) A distributed version control system.
- [**Python 3.7+**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) A compatible version of Python.
- [**Pip:**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) A package manager for installing and managing Python libraries.
- [**Virtualenv:**](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) A tool for creating Python virtual environments.

## üìù Installation Instructions
### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eloin-Centro-Automotivo/toolbox-backend.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd toolbox-backend
```

### 3. Create and activate a virtual environment
- #### 3.1. Install the virtualenv library
    ```bash
    pip install virtualenv
    ```
- #### 3.2. Then, create a virtual environment named `venv`
  - ##### Linux or macOS
      ```bash
      virtualenv venv
      ```
  - ##### Windows
      ```bash
      python -m virtualenv venv
      ```
- #### 3.3. Activate the virtual environment
    - ##### Linux or macOS
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - ##### Windows
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```

### 4. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. Then, install the project dependencies using pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure the database
The application uses SQLite as the database. The database will be created automatically upon the first run of the application. No additional configuration is required.

### 6. Run the application
Start the Flask application with the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```

## üìÇ Insomnia Requests
For greater convenience, an Insomnia file containing all the API requests has been created. This allows you to easily test the endpoints without having to manually configure each request. The file is named `insomnia-requests.json` and is located in the root of the project.

To use this file, follow these steps
1. Open Insomnia.
2. Go to `Application` > `Preferences` > `Data` tab.
3. Click on `Import Data` and select `From File`.
4. Choose the `insomnia-requests.json` file from the root of the project.
5. The requests will be imported and ready to use.

## üìö Usage Examples
Below are examples of how to use the Mechanic Tools Management API endpoints in different scenarios. These examples can help you understand how to interact with the API effectively. By default, the application will run on `localhost:5000`.

- ### üÜï Create a Mechanic
  - To create a new mechanic, send a `POST` request to the `/mechanics` endpoint with the mechanic details in the request body. The request body should be in JSON format as shown below
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Mechanic Name"
    }
    ```

  - If the mechanic is created successfully, the API will respond with a status code `201 Created` and the details of the newly created mechanic in the response body
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Mechanic Name"
    }
    ```

- ### üîç Retrieve a Mechanic by ID
  - To retrieve details of a specific mechanic by its ID, send a `GET` request to the `/mechanics/{id}` endpoint, replacing `{id}` with the actual mechanic ID.
  If the mechanic with the specified ID exists, the API will respond with a status code `200 OK` and the details of the mechanic in the response body

    ```json
    {
	  "id": 1,
	  "name": "Mechanic Name"
    }
    ```

  

## üìå Observations
- **Database:** The application uses SQLite for simplicity. For production environments, consider using more robust databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Report Generation:** Reports are generated in PDF format and stored in memory before being sent as a response. Ensure appropriate permissions if opting to save reports to the file system.
- **Future Extensions:** The application can be extended with additional features such as user authentication, a more elaborate frontend interface, or integrations with other systems.
- **Contributions:** Feel free to contribute improvements or report issues through the GitHub repository.
