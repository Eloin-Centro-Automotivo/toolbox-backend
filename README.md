üìå Observations

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Mechanic and Tool Management:** Allows adding, editing, viewing, and deleting mechanics and tools.
- **Default Inventory:** Assigns a standard set of tools to each mechanic, simplifying inventory management.
- **Daily Tool Conference:** Records missing tools during daily conferences based on the default inventory.
- **PDF Report Generation:** Creates daily and aggregate reports on missing tools, as well as inventory checklists per mechanic.
- **RESTful API:** Provides endpoints for interacting with the application, enabling future integrations or frontend development.

## üí° How It Works
- **Data Management:**
  - **Mechanics:** Add, edit, view, and delete mechanic information.
  - **Tools:** Manage the available tools catalog, including name and category.
- **Default Inventory:**
  - Assign a standard set of tools to each mechanic, facilitating initial setup and ensuring each mechanic has the necessary tools.
- **Daily Conference:**
  - Conduct daily conferences where mechanics report the tools they have. The application identifies which tools are missing based on the default inventory and records these absences.
- **Report Generation:**
  - **Daily Report:** Lists the missing tools on a specific date, grouped by mechanic.
  - **Aggregate Report:** Shows the number of missing instances per tool on a specific date.
  - **Inventory Checklist:** Generates a checklist of standard tools grouped by category for each mechanic.
