## 🚀 Key Features
- **Mechanic and Tool Management:** Allows adding, editing, viewing, and deleting mechanics and tools.
- **Default Inventory:** Assigns a standard set of tools to each mechanic, simplifying inventory management.
- **Daily Tool Conference:** Records missing tools during daily conferences based on the default inventory.
- **PDF Report Generation:** Creates daily and aggregate reports on missing tools, as well as inventory checklists per mechanic.
- **RESTful API:** Provides endpoints for interacting with the application, enabling future integrations or frontend development.

## 💡 How It Works
- **Data Management:**
  - **Mechanics:** Add, edit, view, and delete mechanic information.
  - **Tools:** Manage the available tools catalog, including name and category.
- **Default Inventory:**
  - Assign a standard set of tools to each mechanic, facilitating initial setup and ensuring each mechanic has the necessary tools.
- **Daily Conference:**
  - Conduct daily conferences where mechanics report the tools they have. The application identifies which tools are missing based on the default inventory and records these absences.
- **Report Generation:**
  - **Daily Report:** Lists the missing tools on a specific date, grouped by mechanic.
  - **Aggregate Report:** Shows the number of missing instances per tool on a specific date.
  - **Inventory Checklist:** Generates a checklist of standard tools grouped by category for each mechanic.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies Used
- [**Flask:**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) A lightweight and flexible web framework for Python application development.
- [**SQLAlchemy:**](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for efficient database interactions.
- [**SQLite:**](https://www.sqlite.org/) A lightweight database used for data storage.
- [**ReportLab:**](https://www.reportlab.com/) A library for generating PDF documents.
- [**Python:**](https://www.python.org/) A versatile and widely-used programming language.

## 📋 Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- [**Git:**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) A distributed version control system.
- [**Python 3.7+**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) A compatible version of Python.
- [**Pip:**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) A package manager for installing and managing Python libraries.
- [**Virtualenv:**](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) A tool for creating Python virtual environments.

## 📝 Installation Instructions
### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eloin-Centro-Automotivo/toolbox-backend.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd toolbox-backend
```

### 3. Create and activate a virtual environment
- #### 3.1. Install the virtualenv library
    ```bash
    pip install virtualenv
    ```
- #### 3.2. Then, create a virtual environment named `venv`
  - ##### Linux or macOS
      ```bash
      virtualenv venv
      ```
  - ##### Windows
      ```bash
      python -m virtualenv venv
      ```
- #### 3.3. Activate the virtual environment
    - ##### Linux or macOS
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - ##### Windows
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```

### 4. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. Then, install the project dependencies using pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure the database
The application uses SQLite as the database. The database will be created automatically upon the first run of the application. No additional configuration is required.

### 6. Run the application
Start the Flask application with the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```

## 📌 Observations
- **Database:** The application uses SQLite for simplicity. For production environments, consider using more robust databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Report Generation:** Reports are generated in PDF format and stored in memory before being sent as a response. Ensure appropriate permissions if opting to save reports to the file system.
- **Future Extensions:** The application can be extended with additional features such as user authentication, a more elaborate frontend interface, or integrations with other systems.
- **Contributions:** Feel free to contribute improvements or report issues through the GitHub repository.
